# Order two dataframes on each season

sns.factorplot(x='Progressive Passes %',y='Team',hue='Season',data=ligue_1_passes_fill,kind='bar',palette='seismic')
plt.title('Progressive Passes (as % of Completed Passes) by Team and Season')

# Troyes were 11th in the league for progressive pass % last season
# Down to 13th this season
# Team has even less possession this season, so it's imperative that they play progressively to utilise possession when they do have it
